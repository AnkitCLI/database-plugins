Feature: Mssql Source - Run time scenarios (macro)

  @MSSQL_SOURCE_TEST @MSSQL_SINK_TEST @Mssql_Required
  Scenario: To verify data is getting transferred from Mssql to Mssql successfully using macros for Connection section
    Given Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    When Expand Plugin group in the LHS plugins list: "Source"
    When Select plugin: "SQL Server" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    When Expand Plugin group in the LHS plugins list: "Sink"
    When Select plugin: "SQL Server" from the plugins list as: "Sink"
    Then Connect plugins: "SQL Server" and "SQL Server2" to establish connection
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "SQL Server"
    And Click on the Macro button of Property: "jdbcPluginName" and set the value to: "DriverName"
    And Click on the Macro button of Property: "host" and set the value to: "Host"
    And Click on the Macro button of Property: "port" and set the value to: "Port"
    And Click on the Macro button of Property: "user" and set the value to: "Username"
    And Click on the Macro button of Property: "password" and set the value to: "Password"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "sourceRef"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "database" with value: "databaseName"
    Then Enter textarea plugin property: "importQuery" with value: "selectQuery"
    Then Validate "SQL Server" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "SQL Server2"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "select-jdbcPluginName" with option value: "driverName"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "host" with value: "host" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "port" with value: "port" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "database" with value: "databaseName"

    Then Replace input plugin property: "password" with value: "password" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "targetRef"
    Then Validate "SQL Server2" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Save the pipeline
    Then Preview and run the pipeline
    Then Enter runtime argument value "driverName" for key "DriverName"
    Then Enter runtime argument value from environment variable "host" for key "Host"
    Then Enter runtime argument value from environment variable "port" for key "Port"
    Then Enter runtime argument value from environment variable "username" for key "Username"
    Then Enter runtime argument value from environment variable "password" for key "Password"
    And Run the preview of pipeline with runtime arguments
    Then Verify the preview of pipeline is "success"
    Then Close the preview
    Then Deploy the pipeline
    Then Run the Pipeline in Runtime
    And Enter runtime argument value "driverName" for key "DriverName"

    And Enter runtime argument value from environment variable "username" for key "Username"
    And Enter runtime argument value from environment variable "password" for key "Password"
    And Run the Pipeline in Runtime with runtime arguments
    Then Wait till pipeline is in running state
    Then Open and capture logs
    Then Verify the pipeline status is "Succeeded"
